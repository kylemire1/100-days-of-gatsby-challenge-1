This is my first post! This blog was created from scratch for the first day of the [100 Days of Gatsby Challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/start-blog/).

I'm already pretty familiar with Gatsby, but you're never too experienced for a little bit of a refresh. Also, I think working with Gatsby is so damn fun, I was happy to have a reason to build something like this! Also, it occurred to me that I rarely if ever start building a Gatsby site TOTALLY from scratch. I usually start with [Gatsby Starter Hello World](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) at the very least, so I figured it'd be a great opportunity to refresh myself on what all goes into a bare-bones site.

It was also another great reminder of how wonderful Gatsby's docs are. The plugin readme's and tutorials have just about everything you need to build anything you want. I've recently been reviewing their tutorials since I'm helping train my co-workers to start using it, and I love how they start from the VERY beginning, basically assuming you've done little to no web development before.

Although I was already experienced with the process of putting together a blog, I used this as an opportunity to dig into some things that I hadn't had a chance to use much yet. I used Typography.js and Emotion for the first time! The last large-scale project I did with Gatsby was my personal site, and at that time I was still using CSS modules. After that, I was just slapping simple things together here-and-there, so it never felt like a good opportunity to really dive into Emotion. But wow, I'm so glad I finally did! I don't expect to ever look back to CSS Modules if I can avoid it now.
