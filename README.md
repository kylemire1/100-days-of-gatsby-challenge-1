# Markdown Blog - 100 Days of Gatsby Challenge (Day 1)

"Why share all of your ideas with just Reddit and Twitter? Your best writing needs a home - on your very own blog!

This week, let’s get a Gatsby blog up-and-running from scratch. You’ll get practice setting up your local environment, creating new pages from React components, sourcing content from Markdown files, and deploying your site to a host!

If you are new to Node.js or React development, a Gatsby blog is a terrific project to start with.

Bonus: use your new blog to track your #100DaysOfGatsby progress! Research shows that writing about what you learn, or even what you’re struggling with helps you to retain that information, or even discover a solution. So, during your #100DaysOfGatsby journey, we encourage you to use this blog to write about your ups and downs, victories and challenges." - Hashim Warren
